# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study
Build a logistic regression model 
# Objective
An education company, X Education, offers online courses to industry professionals. Many professionals visit their website daily and are interested in exploring the courses. X Education promotes its courses on various websites and search engines like Google. Visitors to the website may browse courses, fill out a form with their contact information, or watch videos. When someone provides their email address or phone number through a form, they are classified as a lead. The company also acquires leads through past referrals. The sales team then contacts these leads through calls and emails, attempting to convert them into customers. However, the typical lead conversion rate at X Education is around 30%, meaning only about 30 out of 100 leads are converted into customers.

Despite having a significant number of leads, X Education struggles with a low lead conversion rate. To improve this, the company wants to identify the most promising leads, or 'Hot Leads'. By focusing on these potential leads, the sales team could increase the conversion rate, as they would be spending more effort on likely customers rather than contacting all leads indiscriminately. 

To address this, you need to build a logistic regression model that assigns a lead score between 0 and 100 to each lead. A higher score would indicate a 'Hot Lead' with a higher likelihood of conversion, while a lower score would suggest a 'Cold Lead' less likely to convert. Additionally, the company faces other challenges that might require future adjustments to your model. These challenges are detailed in a separate document that you will need to address based on your initial logistic regression model. Make sure to incorporate these details into your final presentation, where you will provide recommendations.
